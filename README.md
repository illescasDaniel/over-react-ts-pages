A template for cool web apps with react, now with GitHub pages compatibility.

**OverReactTS** uses:
+ TypeScript (you'll love the static typing)
+ SASS & CSS Modules *
+ Bootstrap
+ Font awesome 5
+ Routes
+ A basic folder configuration and some examples 
---

\* Sometimes you have to manually run "tcm src" to compile the css modules.
You have to globally install tcm from npm/yarn.

This project uses [recipepuppy](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/)'s api as an example to fetch external content and how to do it in TypeScript.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

And [Create React App TypeScript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript/blob/master/template/README.md).
